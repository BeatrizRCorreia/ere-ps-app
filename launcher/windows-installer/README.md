Instructions:

1. Run "mvn clean install" from the root folder to create an up-to-date version of the ere-ps-app to use
2. Run script createWindowsInstaller.sh to create the installer zip archive in the same folder
3. The launcher will take care of the rest.

Make sure Java is installed on the doctors' computer, it won't be included here.
